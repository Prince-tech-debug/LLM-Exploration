# About libs

First of all if you don't want to setup local python env in your pc ,You can simply switch to google colab (it is prefered since i have already tried setting up local env setting up and developing on google collab is much more efficient.
Secondly, for local env install anaconda it will mostly install all the pre required libs but for the libs which are not installed, you have to install them manually.
